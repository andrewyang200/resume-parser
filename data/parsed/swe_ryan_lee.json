Developed an internal web application with a Flask middleware server, enabling employees to access over 2 million client data points and streamline API communication with Databricks (HTML/CSS, ReactJS). Engineered a collection of automated data pipelines, optimized for distributed data processing, to feed a new blended reporting product. (PySpark, SQL, Databricks). Built unit tests to ensure the consistency of all data pipelines."
